## ðŸŒŸ Usage

To convert a Markdown file to HTML, you can run the following command:

```bash
mdhtml convert <input file>
```

This will create a file called `output.html` in the current directory. You can also specify the output file name:

```bash
mdhtml convert <input file> --output <output file>
```

You can also specify a CSS file to style the HTML file:

```bash
mdhtml convert <input file> --output <output file> --stylesheet <css file>
```

MDHTML also supports watching a file for changes and automatically updating the output file:

```bash
mdhtml convert <input file> --watch
```

If you want, you can also enable an HTTP server with live reloading:

```bash
mdhtml convert <input file> --watch --httpserver
```



To see all available options, you can run:

```bash
mdhtml --help
```
