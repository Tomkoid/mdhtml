# Mastodon
Mastodon is free and open-source software for running self-hosted social networking services. It has microblogging features similar to Twitter, which are offered by many instances, each with its own terms of service, privacy policy, privacy options and content moderation policies.

```javascript
console.log("Hello World");
```

# How it works
Each user is a member of a specific Mastodon instance (also called a server), which can interoperate as a federated social network, allowing users on different instances to interact with each other. This is intended to give users the flexibility to choose instance which they like. Mastodon is also part of the Fediverse, which is a giant circle of servers that can communicate with each other. Mastodon is crowdfunded and does not contain ads.

# Why Mastodon
Unlike Twitter, Mastodon is decentralized and open-source, it can't be sold and won't go bankrupt. It respects your privacy and gives control over the network to the people. On Twitter if you violate the rules or someone in control of the social network doesnâ€™t like you, you might face a ban. However, Mastodon is all about decentralization, as every independent community has administrators with a specific set of regulations in place.
